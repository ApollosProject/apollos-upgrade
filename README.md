# Apollos Upgrade

This repository exposes an untouched Apollos API and UI project.

A dedicated branch per release makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-upgrade/compare/release/0.6.0...release/0.6.1

In the future, this project will be used to enhance the upgrading experience through a command line tool.

See table below for the complete list.
